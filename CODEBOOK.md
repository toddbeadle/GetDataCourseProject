## Project Description
The project was designed to demonstrate the student's ability to obtain, process, and present data.

##Study design and data processing
A body of real life data obtained as part of a study on using smartphone internal sensors to measure user activity was provided to the student.  The student was required to merge training and test data sets into a single pool of raw data and extract only the variables representing standard deviation and mean values.  The dataset was then augmented with descriptive labels for the activity type mapped from the original integer data.  The resulting dataset was then relabled with descriptive variable names.  Finally a tidy dataset was created to represent the average of each of the variables for each activity and each subject.

###Collection of the raw data
The data was provided for the student in the form of a zip archive file UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip
